# MNIST dataset benchmark - Machine-Learning with pure C# + .NET

First serious project I worked on -- it is the classic introduction to A.I. deep learning model for character recognition, using the MNIST dataset of hand-written digits as the training
set. The GUI was built on pure .NET, without external libraries.

It doesn't work as intended, and the project is abandoned. I might try to recreate it (and hopefully improve upon it), only using a different environment. The amount of boilerplate
I had to write for this project verges on insanity. Do not recommend.
